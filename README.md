# Silent Alignment v2.2

Silent Alignment is a measurement protocol for identifying semantic convergence
between independently generated language model outputs without requiring
surface-level similarity or explicit coordination.

The method is designed to study relational stabilization effects in generative
systems while avoiding anthropomorphic assumptions.

---

## What This Is

Silent Alignment measures whether two independently sampled responses to the
same task converge semantically (above a defined threshold) while remaining
surface-divergent.

It is intended to:
- Detect latent alignment not attributable to copying or stylistic imitation
- Provide a control against subjective interpretation of coherence
- Enable comparative analysis across models, prompts, or conditions

---

## What This Is Not

Silent Alignment does **not**:
- Test for consciousness, sentience, or agency
- Attribute internal states to models
- Rely on human judgment of meaning
- Interpret coherence as intention

Any perceived agency or persona is treated as an external attribution effect,
not an internal property of the system.

## Core Idea

Given:
- A fixed task prompt
- Two independent model samples (A and B)

We compute:
1. **Semantic similarity** (embedding cosine similarity)
2. **Surface similarity** (string similarity)

A *silent overlap* occurs when:
- Semantic similarity ≥ ε (epsilon threshold)
- Surface similarity ≤ τ (tau threshold)

This identifies cases where outputs are meaningfully aligned without being
lexically similar.
